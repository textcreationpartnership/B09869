            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A REMONSTRANCE of all the SHOEMAKERS Of <hi>LONDON</hi> and elsewhere, that are against Transporting, Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalling and Ingrossing of LEATHER;</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>hich doth plainly and perfectly shew the reason why Leather is so excessive dear, and so unserviceable for the use of the Common-wealth: the abuse is wholly occasioned by the Leather-sellers, some Curriers, some Coblers, Taylors, Weavers, Button-makers, Broakers, Black-smiths, Chandlers, Tapsters, and that which is worst of all, some Shoe-makers, some of them have left off the Trade and will not work, but scorns to work, and are become sole Merchants of Leather onely, that do buy up all the Leather in some Country Fairs without Comptroule, bragging and boasting the Law can take no hold on them, and they convey what they list beyond Sea, and the rest they keep at home, in their Shops and Cellars, and there sell it at their own Rates, and are grown to such a Head, that it is in vain for any Shoe-maker to go to any Fair or Market with a small quantity of money, but he must be forc'd to come and buy of them; they forestalling, and ingrossing the greatest part of the Leather in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into their own hands: Insomuch that if any of these people before mentioned, do come into any Fair or Market, the best and ablest Shoe-Maker in all <hi>England</hi> must stand off untill they be served, or else out-prize them, which is destructive to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: likewise some of them do keep ten or twelve Shops a piece, others three or four Shops or Cellars, planting both City and Suburbs and Country over; and some of them do return one hundred pounds a week in one Shop; then consider how much the whole Kingdome is prejudiced by these Purse proud people. First, because they forestall and ingross and enhance the price. Secondly because they transport, or sell Leather to Merchants, that do transport. Thirdly, because they buy up so much Leather in Inns, and Tanners yards, which is raked and shaved and hastened in the Tanning, that it is scarce halfe tanned, that sucks water like a Spunge; that people can never go dry on their feet; and Shoes made of such Leather breaks out of the sides, before they be halfe worn. And lastly, consider how many hundred of poor Shoe-makers all <hi>England</hi> over, are tyed up from their proper Rights and freedome of buying Leather at the best hand of the Tanner, but are kept under and forc'd to buy of them, that they get the gain of all that poor Men labour for; and put Chance, if any Man get a poor Livelihood by his Trade, it must be by working such stuff as is not serviceable for the wearer, or if he puts in good stuff, he must exact an unreasonable price upon the Customers, they getting all the gains to themselves as aforesaid; and no Remedy for it, so long as the Curriers and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sellers, and Leather Cutters, as they are so called, are suffered to buy Leather, and fell, as they do, and neither can nor do convert the same Leather into made Wares: There was a Statute made in the first year of the Raign of King <hi>James,</hi> and the two and twentieth Chapter which is yet in force, That no Person or Persons shall buy, sell, bargain, bespeak or take, promise, to have, exchange or put away any Tanned Leather not wrought, and converted into made Wares, but only such Person or Persons, as will and shall work and convert the same Leather into made Wares, upon pain of forfeiture of the Leather so bought, sould, exchanged or put away, or the value thereof. But alas, Information can do no good in such cases, and they are counted odious in most places where ever they come, though their cause be never so good, nor hardly any Jury will allot them any thing, to the great discouragement and utter ruine of his Majesties subjects, and the King deprived of his just Revenues; Therefore let us all Petition to the Kings most excellent Majestie, and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons As-sembled in Parliament: to take it into their serious Consideration, they being in part sufferers by the dearness and badness of Leather, that they stand up for the prosperity of the Land of their Nativity; and to grant a Seizure to take away from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull buyers that cannot work and convert the same Leather into made Wares, and to set such a Fine on the heads of those shoe-makers that may buy Leather lawfully, and yet sell it again Red as it came from the Tanners, as to their grave wisdomes shall think fit▪ and that it may be lawfull for any of his Majesties good subjects to be Seizures, and that it may not be involved to some partic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
